                <h3>Heoliny (Oli) Jung,</h3> <p>22 years of age, is currently a Senior at Indiana University - Bloomington (IU) pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Audio Engineering & Sound Production with a Computer Science minor. Although most of his work nowadays takes place in recording studios, he got his start in the audio industry as a professional mobile DJ, playing gigs in and around the Stony Brook region of Long Island, NY from the early age of 16. As a life-long percussionist, his love for music was a driving factor through most of his time in school and out, as he was a part of a number of orchestras, jazz bands, and his high school's marching band.<br><br>
                Along with his passion for music, Oli also developed an affinity for science and technology. He frequently spent his free time tinkering with computers, whether it was playing video games, messing around with samples on GarageBand, or building custom PCs on his own and with friends. These two fields of music and technology seemed to be separate parts of his life, until one year when he was gifted a midi controller called the Midi Fighter 3D for Christmas. This new musical device combined his two interests perfectly, opening his eyes to a whole new world - one where his two favorite interests worked together to create incredible works of art in innovative and exciting ways.<br><br>

            <div class="six columns" align="left" style="margin-top: 3%">
                <p>Since then, Oli has been pursuing work, projects, and hobbies in music technology. He was not only successful in finding work as a mobile DJing in high school, but also founded his school's Music Technology Club, which still persists to this day. Following his passion, he applied and was accepted into IU's Audio Engineering program and has been studying there ever since. He is a frequent freelancer, even during school - he often DJs at local venues for private parties and works on performance arts productions such as operas, orchestras, and musicals.<br><br>
                Through classes at IU, Oli has gained knowledge in all things audio, ranging from studio engineering and producing to sound for film and visual media. IU has given him deep expertise in acoustic theory and analog electronics, as well as solid foundations for audio digital signal processing. He has explored his passion for technology even further by pursuing a Computer Science minor, taking classes in various programming languages and covering topics from the world wide web to artificial intelligence.<br><br>

His interests are in the fields of studio recording, post-production, game design, and audio software/hardware development.
